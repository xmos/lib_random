This is a wrapper for testing the quality of the PRNG using dieharder.
http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php

It is slow as it runs the random_prng.h library code under simulation.

If this is a problem, copy the lfsr57(), lfsr88(), & lfsr113() functions
into a host application and run nativly, viz test just the algorithm!

The expected usage is:
   axe --args bin/dieharder.xe -g prng57 -n -1 -o - -B | dieharder -g 200 -a
(see dieharder.xe and dieharder help files for details)
